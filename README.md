**this is just a "personal" use module because some of these projects seem abbandoned or not maintained (or i just need the compendium without all the other features) and foundryvtt 0.8.X is annoying with all the warnings, but be free to use if you find useful**

**If any author of the original projects does not agree to use their projects on this, feel free to contact me or open an issue and I will remove the references and the code as soon as possible**

The only work of this module is to import the compendium and colored the title of the compendium.

DnD5e compendium for spells like Find Familiar

This FoundryVTT Module adds a simple compendium pack to help with DnD5e spells that summon creatures.
It is nothing fancy. My players were casting find familiar and I tried to use the npc creatures that
are in the DnD5e system and it wasn't working.  So all I did was create actor/player types for each 
creature they could summon.

Hope this saves you some time.  

Right now this only supports the following spells:
* Find Familiar
* Unseen Servant

### Updated

* Added new find familiar macro. You can find it in the macro compendium.

### How to Use It

* Go to the compendium tab and you will find the Summoner compendium.
* Select the creature that the player wants to summon and right click it and select import
* Finally, assign permissions to the player so they can interact with the token.

## [Supplemental Bestiary Pack](https://github.com/sparkcity/fvtt-supplementalbestiary)

A module that adds homebrew creatures to your D&D 5e game.

### Description

This module contains additional homebrewed monsters for D&D 5E to be used in Foundry VTT.
* Current Count: 45

## [FoundryVTT Lingering Injuries](https://gitlab.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-lingering-injuries)

Lingering Injuries by Damage Type

#### A compendium for use the Lingering Injuries by Damage Type, based on the article (http://farlandworld.com/injuries.html)

It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering injury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under the following circumstances:

- When it takes a critical hit.
- When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright.
- When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more.

To determine the nature of the injury, determine the type of damage that triggered the injury and roll on the appropriate table below that corresponds to the damage type. If multiple types of damage caused the injury, use the type that dealt the majority of damage, or randomly determine the damage type to use when you roll for the lingering injury. 

These tables assume a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types. If you choose, you can also allow injuries that require regeneration or other high level magic to heal naturally, given a substantial amount of time.

The damages types are:

##### Acid

## [1001 Fish](https://github.com/cswendrowski/FoundryVTT-1000-Fish)

A rollable table of 1001 fish, created by burkenhare #4761 (Discord) 

"Typical use:
PC wants to roll for a survival check, after the party makes camp alongside a river. The GM makes them roll on the d1000 fish table to determine what kind of fish they catch (thank god there is such a thing, or else it would be trout every time!) .  They roll a 210, why, it's a cownose ray! But every adventurer knows that the cownose ray is a saltwater animal, that could only mean one thing.... FLOOD!
So you see, it can be used in many ways to contribute to the plot." - Burkenhare

A module to add support for ME5e, a futuristic sci-fi setting, to your 5e world. Includes most compendium content from ME5e excluding that which would infringe on copyright.

## [FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants](https://github.com/KyleBishop/FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants)

https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/83oupp/brodericks_compendium_plants_and_fungi_across_the/ ). I did not create any of the plants. This addon includes rolltables for the following regions as per the source material: 
* Arctic 
* City 
* Coastal 
* Desert 
* Forest
* Jungle 
* Mountain 
* Ocean 
* Plains 
* River 
* Swamp 
* Underdark/Cave

Roll tables and plants are included as compendiums. Open up the roll table and select the region type your party is searching in. Results will be added to a "Found Plants" loot actor for distribution to the players.

### Suggested Use
I currently use this in my campaign to allow players to forage. If you use the included roll tables for the region(s) they are in, you can select the Generate Loot button on the table, it will create a new instance of the item on the Actor "Found Plants" in the Actors tab (it will create that loot actor if you don't have it already). 

I also have Forien's Unidentified Items add-on and right click the new plant and mystify before letting the players see it/access it. You can save a copy to your items for reference if you want.

## Home brew

**Spiked**

When hit by a weapon with the spiked property the target gains {@dice +1} damage.

## Beginner Baubles

**Aquatic**
Some weapons are as aquadynamic as they are aerodynamic. The wielder doesn't have disadvantage on melee weapon attacks or ranged weapon attacks within normal range when using a weapon that has this property.

**Concealed**
Some weapons are designed to be easily concealed. The wielder has advantage on Dexterity or Charisma checks made to hide or coneal a weapon that has this property.

**Dexterous**
Some weapons require precision to wield effectively. When attacking with a weapon that has this property, the wielder uses their Dexterity modifier for their attack and damage rolls, in place of Strength.

**Disguised (basic)**
Some weapons are best hidden in plain sight. Such implements are designed to resemble common, everyday objects and can be easily mistaken as such. Identifying the true intent of a weapon that has this property requires a close inspection and a DC 10 Intelligence (investigation) or Wisdom (perception) check; or at least an hour spent in close proximity to it and a passive Perception score of 15 or higher.

**Disguised (elaborate)**
Some weapons are best hidden in plain sight. Such implements are designed to resemble common, everyday objects and can be easily mistaken as such. Identifying the true intent of a weapon that has this property requires a close inspection and a DC 15 Intelligence (investigation) or Wisdom (perception) check; or at least an hour spent in close proximity to it and a passive Perception score of 20 or higher.

**Disguised (intricate)**
Some weapons are best hidden in plain sight. Such implements are designed to resemble common, everyday objects and can be easily mistaken as such. Identifying the true intent of a weapon that has this property requires a close inspection and a DC 20 Intelligence (investigation) or Wisdom (perception) check; or at least an hour spent in close proximity to it and a passive Perception score of 25 or higher.

**Lethal**
Some weapons are unusually dangerous and difficult to handle with care. The wielder can choose to deal non-lethal damage with a weapon that has this property, however they have disadvantage on attack rolls made to do so.

**Monastic**
Some weapons favored by martial combatants are still choice implements of monks and their kind. A martial weapon that has this property counts as a monk weapon.

**Non-lethal**
Some weapons are ill-suited to inflicting mortal wounds. The wielder can choose to deal lethal damage with a weapon that has this property, however they have disadvantage on attack rolls made to do so.

**Parrying**
Some weapons are ideally suited to bolster their wielder's defence. If a creature is wielding one or more weapons with this property and does not use them to make an attack on their turn in combat, their armor class increases by 1 against melee attacks until the start of their next turn.

## Item and Equipment Properties

**Partial Armor**

Partial armor only grants its AC bonus if you are wearing light or no armor. If you are wearing only one piece of partial armor, you are still considered to be wearing your base armor type (e.g. no armor or light armor). If you are wearing two pieces of partial armor, you are considered to be wearing the heaviest type among the armor pieces you are wearing (e.g. medium or heavy armor). You cannot benefit from wearing three or more pieces of partial armor.
